                  <tr>
                    <td><div align="justify">I, Shailaja Ashok Goundaje, completed my Diploma in Electrical Engineering and got married.   				I was blessed with three children who were completely normal at the time of birth. However, after some period,   				all the three children were caught by fever and had fits followed by development of  mentally retardedness one   				after another. I was totally collapsed by the psychological shock due to this calamity. I could not understand   				why the destiny is playing with such a hide and seek game. I lost all hope worth living and there was a big   				question of how to provide care to all my three children. There was no  proper treatment for such children in   				society. Society considered them outcast and neglected them. In such a situation how to face the society as   				mother of three mentally retarded children. Our family life also got disturbed due to  this new responsibility.   				As if there was some dark evil shadow hovering over our family. While struggling in such darkness of frustration,   				I saw a new ray of hope in the form of Wai Training Centre of Wai Akshar Institute. This was an institute for   				giving comprehensive training of how to take care and handle mentally retarded children. The training course was   				of one year duration. To strengthen my children psychologically to enable them to live normal life in society and   				to extend this help to other such children from society, I completed DSE (MR) training course in 2002. As per my   				many aspirations my objective and dream was to start a special school in Kupwad for mentally retarded children.   				It was a very difficult task. There was problem of financial support and land for school. However, as I was firm   				in my decision, I decided to start the school in our own house for convenience. <br />
                      <br />
                      Today, society looks to the mentally retarded children by scornful eyes. However, mentally retarded child is   				not psychic. The greatest punishment to parents in the world is birth of mentally retarded child and its care   				taking. If these children get proper guidance through special school, they can live normal life. Even after   				parents expire, these children can live normal life with necessary  protection in residential school. And   				specifically with this objective, a special school under the auspices of Ajinkya Foundation, was started for   				mentally retarded children on 1st July 2002.<br />
                      <br />
                      There were many difficulties before me. Generally the parents are not ready to send their mentally retarded   				children to school. Because they do not believe that their child will improve. Hence I visited all parents   				of such children in Kupwad area and convinced them about necessity of special school and prompted them for   				sending their children to school.<br />
                      The school which was started only with my own three children on 1st July 2002, is  now teaching 30  children.   				With the help of 7 staff, the small plant of this school is making progress in development and training of   				these children. </div></td>
